My [tidbits](https://github.com/joshuamorton/tidbits) repository serves as a
place to store things that don't belong anywhere else. It contains short
projects that don't deserve their own place. Things like musings on python
internals and thoughts that end up being blog posts. Some of the coolest pieces
are a 

 - [collaborative filter implementation in
   scala](https://github.com/joshuamorton/tidbits/blob/master/CollabFilter.scala),
 - an implementation of [an object system that supports
   inheritance](https://github.com/joshuamorton/tidbits/blob/master/objectModel.py),
 - a [short lisp
   interpreter](https://github.com/joshuamorton/tidbits/blob/master/lispy.py)
   written by a friend and me.
 - [swizzling, but in
   python](https://github.com/joshuamorton/tidbits/blob/master/swizzle.py)
