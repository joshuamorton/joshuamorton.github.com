[The Agency](https://github.com/gtagency) is the Undergraduate Automated
Intelligence Research club at Georgia Tech. Each semester the club tries to
implement a project and learn concepts about AI and ML in the process. We also
have some long term projects, and give weekly presentations on interesting
topics in the field.

Some of the projects I was involved in include:

 - [A Tetris bot](https://github.com/gtagency/tetris-python)
 - [Graph visualization using simulated annealing](https://github.com/gtagency/graph-reduction)
 - [Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile)
 - [Natural Language Experiments](https://github.com/gtagency/newage-lateral-piping)
 - [Thompson Sampling](https://github.com/gtagency/thompson_sampling)

We also hold events and Tech Talks. As an officer, I did
[presentations](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bys9BGMJRUovS1RpWThwUUVXZnM&usp=sharing)
on some of the following topics:

 - Collaborative Filters and Recommender Systems
 - Autonomous Vehicles and AV pipelines
 - n-grams and Markov Chain text generation
 - Experementation, multi-armed bandits, and Monte-Carlo Tree Search

While an undergraduate, I served as the secretary and later as the External
Relations officer, doing things like organizing talks from industry and
academia.
