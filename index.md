####About Me

![my face](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/jmortonface.jpg)

Hi! I'm Joshua, a third year Computer Science major currently studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm heavily involved with the College of Computing, and currently serve as a Career Ambassador, helping to mentor students in preparation for eventually entering the workforce. I love python and machine learning.

When I'm not busy being a nerd, I enjoy circus arts. I juggle, and [diabolo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLjUsD_ymWw), and when I can I play on a trapeze.

I don't buy my own shirts.
