I'm heavily involved with the College of Computing, and currently serve as a Career Ambassador, helping to mentor students in preparation for eventually entering the workforce. I love python and machine learning.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not busy being a nerd, I enjoy circus arts. I juggle, and diabolo, and when I can I play on a trapeze.\r\n\r\nI don't buy my own shirts.","google":"UA-67835911-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
