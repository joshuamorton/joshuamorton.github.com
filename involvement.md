#####The Agency
[The Agency](https://github.com/gtagency) is the Undergraduate Automated Intelligence Research club at Georgia Tech. We do various projects and teach students concepts about AI and introduce them to both academic and industry based aspects of the field. In general, we enjoy working on projects:

 - [A Tetris bot](https://github.com/gtagency/tetris-python)
 - [Graph visualization using simulated annealing](https://github.com/gtagency/graph-reduction)
 - [Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile)

We also hold events and Tech Talks. As an officer, I do [presentations](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bys9BGMJRUovS1RpWThwUUVXZnM&usp=sharing)
