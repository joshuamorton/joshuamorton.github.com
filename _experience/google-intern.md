    As a SETI intern, I built infrastructure to allow more efficient testing of
    frontend Youtube webcomponents and improved tooling for making large
    refactors to existing Youtube tests.

During the summer of 2016, I interned with Google as a Software Engineer, Tools
and Infrastructure intern. I worked with the Youtube Desktop Main Application
team. I worked on two main projects, one to allow refactoring files for certain
kinds of tests more efficiently. The other, my major project, involved creating
a testing library for a redesign of Youtube.
