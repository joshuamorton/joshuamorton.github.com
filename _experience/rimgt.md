    I built a machine learning vizualization for a demo at ICRA 2015.

In 2015, I worked with Professor [Heni Ben Amor](http://henibenamor.weebly.com/)
while he was still a postdoc at Georgia Tech. While working with him, I
implemented a tool to connect to a dataglove over the internet and in real time
recognize, classify, and vizualize the pose of the user's hand.

The application was written in C++ and used OpenSceneGraph to render the
vizualization, and connected to WEKA via the Java Native Interface to to the
machine learning and classification with a simple single layer neural network.
The tool was used in a presentation at ICRA 2015.
