    A tool to help gesture designers create gesture based interactions.
---

In Fall 2016, I worked with [Aman Parnami](http://amanparnami.com/), a PhD
student at Tech on his thesis project,
[Mogeste](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2971395). My project was an
extension to the existing mobile appliciation that would allow multiple gesture
designers to work collaboratively. As part of this project, I ported the
existing device-local database to a webserver, and extended it with multiple
users and user interaction.

I was also able to explore some of the possible applications of machine learning
in a collaborative context, including attempting to suggest collaborators to
designers based on similarity.

Unfortunately, the code for this project is private and I cannot share my
contributions.
