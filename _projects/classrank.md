[ClassRank](https://github.com/joshuamorton/ClassRank) has been my pet project
since my freshman summer. I started by [proving some facts about collaborative
filtering](https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/joshuamorton/ClassRank/builds/c7ae4929b2575f232753d366ce574833a94864ee/raw/output.pdf)
using that to build an application to help recommend classes for students to
take. 

This project has developed into my [CS Capstone
Project](https://github.com/classrank), that I'm developing with a few
classmates. It is built in python, using a variety of tools and libraries,
including Tornado, numpy, scipy, and various testing and continutous integration
tools.
