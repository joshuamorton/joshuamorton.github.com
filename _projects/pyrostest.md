    An easy to use testing library for ROS-based robotics.
---

[Pyrostest](https://github.com/gtagency/pyrostest) is a ROS testing toolkit
originally developed to help write tests for Buzzmobile, but that has since been
converted into a standalone tool and python package. It is small, easy to use,
and was a pain to create.
