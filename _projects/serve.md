    Hackathon project at MHacks IV that was designed to help new hackers create
    a backend webservice for their website quickly and intuitively.
---

I attended [MHacks IV](http://mhacks-iv.devpost.com/) and while there developed
[Serve](https://github.com/thepav/serve), an application to help hackathon-goers
build super simple web applications more efficiently. By housing a simple single
endpoint API in a docker instance, and providing a small database to back the
system, we created a platform that would allow hackers to build tools without
sweating how their system worked. It just would.

We were finalists.
