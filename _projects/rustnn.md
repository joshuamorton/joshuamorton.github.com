I had a few weeks of downtime, and was interested in learning rust and
re-learning the math and theory behind neural networks, so I felt it would be an
interesting project to implement, from scratch, a network and the related
mathematical primitives in rust as a learning exercise.
[rustnn](https://github.com/joshuamorton/rustnn) is the result of that work.
