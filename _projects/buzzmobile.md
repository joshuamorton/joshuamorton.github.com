[Buzzmobile](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile) is The Agency's autonomous
parage float, vehicle, and research platform. I've worked on the project in a
variety of roles, starting as a newbie learning about ROS, and working my way up
to lead, I've implemented parts of the project including the tools to honk the
horn, a way to visualize what the vehicle sees in real time, and helped design
the system as a whole.

In 2016, I took a backseat role in the implementation of the autonomous parts of
Grouch, leaving that to newer membership, and instead focused on improving the
build pipeline and automated testing infrastructure for the project, to make
sure that future progress would not be hindered by tooling issues.
