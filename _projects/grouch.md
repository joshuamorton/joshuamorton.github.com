    A web scraper and API for the Georgia Tech Course Catalog.
---

While working on ClassRank, I came across a common issue: there are lots of
people at Georgia Tech who want to work with data about courses and schedules,
but there was no good way to access this data. OSCAR, the online course catalog,
is dated and hard to access. To solve this, I built and publicized
[Grouch](https://github.com/gttools/Grouch), an easily extensible tool that can
parse the data from OSCAR into json and other formats without a lot of time or
expertise.
