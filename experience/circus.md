During high-school summers, I worked as a Camp Counselor at [Circus
Camp](http://www.circuscamp.org/). As I worked my way from Counselor in
Training, to Jr. Counselor to Counselor, my responsibilities grew. I began
simply teaching juggling and unicycling to campers, but eventually could also
teach and spot acrobatics and aerial trapeze and silks. My other
responsibilities included checking equipment safety, inventory, setup, teardown,
keeping track of small rambunctious children, and entertaining them throughout
the day with improvisation, shows, and comedy.

At the camp, each week would end with a camp-wide show in which campers would
perform. I also helped design, plan, build props, and perform in these shows.
