####Experience

#####College of Computing
I work for the College of Computing at Georgia Tech as a Career Ambassador. This involves reviewing students' resumes, running mock interviews, and developing curricula for improving students' career-preparedness.

#####Decision First Technologies
During the summer of 2015 I interned with [Decision First Technologies](http://www.decisionfirst.com/), a small Atlanta-based SAP parter for business intelligence consulting. I worked on three major projects. In addition to the three projects, I helped to design and build client dashboards.

The first project was to create an end-user installer for a [Salesforce-BusinessObjects integration tool](http://www.decisionfirst.com/offerings/salesforce-connect-for-sap-analytics/). This involved building a Java-based GUI and command line application to gather information from an existing BusinessObjects installation and use it to automatically configure a server. Additionally, we improved the process to create a specific salesforce installation.

The second was to build a specialized set of internal tooling for BusinessObjects dashboards. Specifically, a common client request was for dashboards to contain a table of database-bound key performance indicators along with summary analytics for them. The tool I created was a javascript extension to an existing BusinessObjects component that would allow the streamlined creation of KPI tables and the included charts (such as bulletcharts, sparklines, and other KPI indicators). The tool was built in javascript using [d3](http://d3js.org/) for visualizations.

The final project was an exploratory implementation of an alternate BusinessObjects backend. Instead of a Java and tomcat-based system, the interns suggested we design a python-based system built on Flask and SQLAlchemy because it would be both faster and easier to use. The system we designed was both, however it was difficult to impossible to deploy on client systems. We did use it to streamline the process of building and testing dashboards and visualizations.

#####Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab
I worked as a research assistant with [Heni Ben Amor](http://henibenamor.weebly.com/), who is now an assistant professor at Arizona State. While working with him, I implemented a tool to connect to a [dataglove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_glove) and, in real time, visualize and classify the pose of the user's hand.

The application, built in C++ and Java, used [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) to visualize the motion and connected to [WEKA](https://weka.wikispaces.com/) via the Java Native Interface, allowing the tool to build a classifier and then classify hand poses in real time once a trained classifier was provided. Heni used the code in a talk at ICRA 2015.

#####Circus Camp
During high-school summers, I worked as a Camp Counselor at [Circus Camp](http://www.circuscamp.org/). As I worked my way from Counselor in Training, to Jr. Counselor to Counselor, my responsibilities grew. I began simply teaching juggling and unicycling to campers, but eventually could also teach and spot acrobatics and aerial trapeze and silks. My other responsibilities included checking equipment safety, inventory, setup, teardown, keeping track of small rambunctious children, and entertaining them throughout the day with improvisation, shows, and comedy.

At the camp, each week would end with a camp-wide show in which campers would perform. I also helped design, plan, build props, and perform in these shows.
