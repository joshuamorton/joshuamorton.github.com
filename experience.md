### [Google](google-intern)
During the summer of 2016 I interned at Google, working with the Youtube Desktop
Testing team to improve testing infrastructure.

### College of Computing

I worked for the College of Computing at Georgia Tech as a Career Ambassador.
This involves reviewing students' resumes, running mock interviews, and
developing curricula for improving students' career-preparedness.

### [Decision First Technologies](dft)

I interned over the summer of 2015, building internal tooling and prototypes.

### Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab

I worked as a research assistant with [Heni Ben
Amor](http://henibenamor.weebly.com/), who is now an assistant professor at
Arizona State. While working with him, I implemented a tool to connect to a
[dataglove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_glove) and, in real time,
visualize and classify the pose of the user's hand.

The application, built in C++ and Java, used
[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) to visualize the motion and
connected to [WEKA](https://weka.wikispaces.com/) via the Java Native Interface,
allowing the tool to build a classifier and then classify hand poses in real
time once a trained classifier was provided. Heni used the code in a talk at
ICRA 2015.

### [Circus Camp](circus)

During High School, I worked at Circus Camp, a bit different than all of the
Computer Science I do now, but a great experience nonetheless.
