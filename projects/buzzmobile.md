[Buzzmobile](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile) is The Agency's autonomous
parage float, vehicle, and research platform. I've worked on the project in a
variety of roles, starting as a newbie learning about ROS, and working my way up
to lead, I've implemented parts of the project including the tools to honk the
horn, a way to visualize what the vehicle sees in real time, and helped design
the system as a whole.
