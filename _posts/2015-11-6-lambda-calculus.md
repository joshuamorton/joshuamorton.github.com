title: Lambda Calculus

I recently got to do a presentation on lambda calculus for an organization at my school, the Big O theory club. It was fun, since this is a topic that I didn't have a huge amount of familiarity with already. Hopefully at some point I'll be able to get a breakdown as a text post, but for now here's the presentation.
