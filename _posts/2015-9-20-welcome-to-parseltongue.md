My name is Josh, and this is my blog. I happen to be a huge fan of python, and have over time written a few tutorials and posts about things in the language. Further, I'm a huge nerd when it comes to language design and theory. So while a lot of what is posted here will be in python, and regarding (mostly) CPython, not everything will be, and many posts will likely be theoretical in nature, with python simply the chosen implementation language. 

I was hoping that I was super creative, and that "Parseltongue" was a completely new name for a python related idea, but sadly that's not the case. There already exists a [package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parseltongue/0.0.1) by that name, as well as a [talk at PyCon Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cuQEOP7BsA).

Keep on the lookout for cool things about functional programming, decorators, lambda calculus, some basic type theory, and some of the inner workings of the python language.
